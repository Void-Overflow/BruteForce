# SHA256-Generator

Welcome to Brute Force!
This is a pretty basic application used for Brute Forcing.
Now you may be asking, what do we provide that others don't, well for starters
we have a file that logs every Brute Force you have created so you don't lose it.
This is in the Logs folder.
We also do NOT keep track of our users data. We understand privacy is 
sacred and we do NOT take advantage of that.

To use it, please open the .exe file in the folder from where you downloaded it. Using it should
be pretty straight forward. Every hash you make is loged. To find the logged hashes, go to the Logs folder,
there sohould be . Then from there, you can view your previously made brute forces. 
For personal help, please submit an issue on this repository.

Like I prevously said, it's a pretty straightforward software. We DO have rules. One huge one is REDISTRIBUTION OF THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT ALLOWED, and WE DO NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABLITY FOR WHAT IS DONE WITH THIS SOFTWARE! For more rules, please read the TOS.txt file lovated in your SHA256 folder. Other than that, feel free to hash away! 

This software is managed and owned by
